1. I want to use global sources but not store my source.key_name.properties file in bio/sources/SOURCE/resources.

How can I do this?

This leads into question 2, what are the best practices for maintaining code?  I don't necessily want to have symlinks
everywhere or deal with broken paths.   Perhaps there should be concept of core and contributed sources?

2. Can I load concatenated fasta files?

3. Where does data fetching and munging belong?  As part of each source?
