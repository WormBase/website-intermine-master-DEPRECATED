Repository: website-intermine-master

This repository contains the master configuration files,
data fetching and processing code for the Intermine instance
at WormBase.

It should be checked out into your intermine source into a
directory named "wormmine":

 > cd ~/projects/intermine/
 > git clone http://github.com/WormBase/website-intermine-master wormmine

Setup

  mkdir ~/.intermine
  cp wormmine.properties ~/.intermine/.

General Use

   Data will be mirrored to and processed in:
       /usr/local/wormbase/intermine/data

   And versioned according to the WormBase release being built:
      /usr/local/wormbase/intermine/data/current -> WS229

Fetching and loading a single dataset:

   By example, here's how to fetch and load genomic fasta
   and core annotations.

   # Fetch   
   > ./scripts/get_genomic_fasta_and_annotation.pl --release WS229

   # Load
   > cd integrate
   > ant -Dsource=celegans-genome-fasta -v
   > ant -Dsource=celegans-gff3 -v


To do a full build:

    
Current datasets:

   Uniprot
   Interpro
   Genomic fasta sequence
   Gene models (ncRNAs and pseudogenes needs work.
   Gene ontology
   Publications
   Entrez Organisms
